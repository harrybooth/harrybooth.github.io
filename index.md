## About me

I am a computational researcher at The Francis Crick Institute, working in the field of evolutionary development. I am a mathematician/computer scientist by training, and my research in evo-dev was really born out of my long held interests in complex system topics. I am always interested in seeking different abstractions of processes - the commonalities I find and the roads they take me down are responsible for an ever growing list of interests! 

## Education / Work Experience

I studied Mathematics at the University of Warwick (MMath), before working in quantitative finance (risk). At some point I realised that a scratch had not been itched, and so I embarked on the Scientific and Data Intensive Computing course at University College London on a part-time basis. This was completed in September 2021. I then left finance, and started a role as a Senior Laboratory Research Scientist in the [Hadjivasiliou Lab](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/zena-hadjivasiliou)

## Other Projects and Interests

1. __process music__
Steve Reich defines process music not as, "the process of composition but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes." I am interested in exploring the concept of music emerging from computational processes, in particular systems which mimic development. I intend to implement these experiments using [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

2. __open ended evolution__
Differential equations are often used to represent biological systems. Any equation is a representation. I am interested in different representations, particularly ones which can be exploited by in-silico evolution to generate vast but tractable complexity. How could we give in-silico evolution as much freedom as evolution has in the physical world?

3. __digital twins__
Digital twins are a in-silico representation of some system. Often they adopt a bottom-up philosophy - the systems complexity emerges from modelling many interacting parts at the most basic level.
