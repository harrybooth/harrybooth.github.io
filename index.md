## About me

I studied Mathematics at the University of Warwick (MMath), before entering the world of work (finance). At some point I realised that a scratch had not been fully itched, and therefore embarked on the Scientific and Data Intensive Computing course at University College London on a part-time basis.  

##  UCL : Scientific and Data Intensive Computing

This section describes some example projects I completed as part of the course. I give a short description before providing links to code and written papers. 

###  Final Course Projects

#### Numerical Optimisation : Support Vector Machines
#### Inverse Problems : Regularization, wavelet denoiser and poission noise model
#### Morphogenetic Programming: 

### Dissertation
