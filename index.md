## About me

I studied Mathematics at the University of Warwick (MMath), before entering the world of work (finance). At some point I realised that a scratch had not been fully itched, and I therefore embarked on the Scientific and Data Intensive Computing course at University College London on a part-time basis. I completed the course in September 2021, receiving a distinction.

This section describes some example projects I completed as part of the course. I give a short description before providing links to code and written reports. 

###  Final Course Projects

1. __High Performance Computing in Python - In The Moment Of Heat:__
Course leader: Timo Betcke. This project required us to solve one of the problems from the [Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred-dollar,_Hundred-digit_Challenge_problems). We were tasked with solving problem 8 - "In the moment of heat" - using only python. The jupyter notebook with my solution can be found [here](), and achieves 10 accurate digits.
2. __Numerical Optimisation - Support Vector Machines:__
Course leader: Marta Betcke. This project required us to research two optimization methods within the context of support vector machines, and produce a study involving some computational experiments. I chose SMO (sequential minimal optimization) and stochastic gradient descent. My report achieved the maximum mark, and can be found <a href="harrybooth.github.io/folder/Support_Vector_Machines.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
3. __Inverse Problems - Regularization, Wavelet Denoisers and Poission Noise Models:__
Course leader: Simon Arridge. This project required us to solve a variety of computational problems from a inverse problems selection of topics. My report can be found [here]() along with supporting notebooks.
4. __Morphogenetic Programming:__
Course leader: Martha Tsigkari. 6 mini projects, incl. 3D game of life, L-Systems, Particle Systems, Quad Trees, Genetic algorithms and Gene Regulatory Networks. All experiments completed using grasshopper scripts (C#) and Rhino 3D. Scripts and animations can be found [here](). 

### Dissertation

1. __Growing Flags with Fractal Proteins__
Supervised by Peter Bentley. The phenotypes of biological organisms are incredibly complex. Comparitively, the amount of genetic material is extremely small. This project investigated artificial models of development which permit compact genetic representations, from both a conceptual and experimental
standpoint. The original dissertation can be found [Link](url). Stay tuned for the paper which is due to appear in the journal of artificial life in 2022 - [Link](url).  

## Current and Future Projects

1. __Process music with Julia__
Steve Reich defines process music not as, "the process of composition but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes." I am interested in exploring the concept of music emerging from computational processes, in particular artificial development systems. I intend to implement these experiments using [Julia Music](https://github.com/JuliaMusic).
3. __Fractal Development Systems__ 
I intend to further develop ideas from my dissertation. In particular I would like to extend the multi-cellular model into 3D, and develop more complex forms. I also intend to refine further the fractal protein regulatory mechanisms. 
5. __Wikipedia steiner graphs__
Inspired by the game of "wiki-surfing", the aim is to build a program which constructs an approximate (as NP-hard) steiner tree given a collection of topics on wikipedia.
