## About me

I studied Mathematics at the University of Warwick (MMath), before entering the world of work (finance). At some point I realised that a scratch had not been fully itched, and therefore embarked on the Scientific and Data Intensive Computing course at University College London on a part-time basis. I completed the course in September 2021, receiving a distinction.

This section describes some example projects I completed as part of the course. I give a short description before providing links to code and written reports. 

###  Final Course Projects

1. __High Performance Computing in Python - In The Moment Of Heat:__
Course leader: Timo Betcke. This project required us to solve one of the problems from the [Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred-dollar,_Hundred-digit_Challenge_problems). This was a competition based around a collection of 10 difficult problems in numerical mathematics published by Nick Trefethem in 2002. Each problem has a single numeric answer, and the original contest involved multiple teams competing to obtain as many accurate digits as possible across the 10 problems. We were tasked with solving problem 8 - "In the moment of heat" - using only python. The jupyter notebook with my solution can be found [here](), and achieves 10 accurate digits.
2. __Numerical Optimisation - Support Vector Machines:__
Course leader: Marta Betcke. This project required us to research two optimization methods within the context of support vector machines, and produce a study involving some computational experiments. I chose SMO (sequential minimal optimization) and stochastic gradient descent. My report achieved the maximum mark, and can be found [here]() along with supporting notebooks. 
3. __Inverse Problems - Regularization, Wavelet Denoisers and Poission Noise Models:__
Course leader: Simon Arridge. This project required us to solve a variety of computational problems from a selection of topics from inverse problems. My report can be found [here]() along with supporting notebooks.
4. __Morphogenetic Programming:__
Course leader: Martha Tsigkari. 7 mini projects, incl. 3D game of life, L-Systems, Genetic algorithms, and Gene Regulatory Networks. All experiments completed using grasshopper scripts (C#) and Rhino 3D. 

### Dissertation

1. __Growing Flags with Fractal Proteins__
Supervised by Peter Bentley. This project aimed to . The original dissertation can be found [Link](url). Stay tuned for the paper which is due to appear in the journal of artificial life in 2022 - [Link](url)._  

## Current and Future Projects

1. __Process music with Julia__
2. __Fractal Development__ 
3. __Wikipedia steiner graphs__
